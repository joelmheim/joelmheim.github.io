I must say that I was a bit surprised when I read about Bruce Eckel and his problems in getting the grip on Java
Generics in his <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=117200">blog</a>, where he's saying that even
he finds Java 5 very complex and has spent a lot of time writing the new chapters on Concurrency and Generics for
Thinking in Java 4th ed.

I'd heard so many good things about this before and so I decided to check this out for myself. I readily admit that the
prospect of getting rid of these incessant casts in iterators gets me a little excited. But when I started out using
Java 5 on this little home project of mine, I kept getting dragged of into side issues with this thing. Maybe its my
design, or the fact that I'm just starting out with generics, but there are so many little things to watch out for that
it is easy to get lost in the technical issues of it all.

I'll admit that I haven't really spent enough time to form a solid opinion on this, but I don't feel like it is coming
together as well as I'd hoped. Will report more once I've had some further experiences.
