I've just arrived in Aarhus for this years JAOO conference. I've written before about how much I love this conference,
and I hope it's going to be the same this year. There is certainly no shortage of brilliant speakers and interesting
talks.

Tomorrow (Sunday), I'll be in a tutorial on Ruby on Rails, which I don't really need, but it'll be good to meet Glen
Vanderburg, and on Monday the conference starts proper. Finally I'll participate in a tutorial on Pattern-Oriented
Software Architeture

I will try to post my experiences and reflections over the next few days. Hopefully I'll have as good a time this year
as I've had the previous years.

Stay tuned...
