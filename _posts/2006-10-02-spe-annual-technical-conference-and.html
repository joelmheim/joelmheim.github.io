I just returned from San Antonio, Texas, where a collegue and myself were fortunate enough to be allowed to participate
with a paper on software agents and their potential in the upstream oil business.

The conference was a huge success for us. Lots of interest in our paper, and we learned some things about the state of
practice as well. And quite frankly we are not impressed.

San Antonio was very nice, as well. It is a very nice city, and we got to se a lot of it. The weather was nice as well
with the temperature in the high twenties, low thirties all week (centigrades of course). We enjoyed the riverwalk, the
Alamo and the other sights tremendously. Even got some souvenirs...
