The Call for Submission of the [SATURN 2017](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/saturn/2017/) is now open.

I would very much appreciate it if you took the time to read it and consider submitting a proposal for a talk. The conference is focused on software architecture as the name suggests, and we are especially looking for experience reports from you real-world projects.

Look forward to seeing you in Denver next May!
