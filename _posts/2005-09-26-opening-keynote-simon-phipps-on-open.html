Simon Phipps is the Chief Officer for Open Source at Sun Microsystems, which makes him a guy to listen to and with power
to change stuff in the open source space.

He  talked about what he calls the "Participation Age" to describe the era we're in now. In this era open source is the
model for building software. But open source is not enough. Standards must be in place to enable the companies to add
value to  the  open source commons.  Many business models are possible around open source.

Also interoperability is required for the users to be able to achieve the freedom that open source is all about for
them.

A very interessting talk, that for me at least opened some new perspectives on the open source space.
