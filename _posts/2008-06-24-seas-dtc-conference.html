Today and tomorrow I'm in Edinburgh for the Systems Engineering for Autonomous Systems conference. This is a conference
on autonomous systems put on by the British Ministry of Defense, presenting the results of research done for mostly
military purpose.

Then why am I here? The short answer is that we try to learn what we can about building autonomous systems in our own
domain (oil and gas operations), and the research has come furthest in the military domain. We were first turned on to
this conference last year by our good friends at <a href="http://www.agent-software.com/">AOS</a> last year, and have
been participating ever since. This year it is my turn.

I hope to learn as much as I can about the wast range of topics presented, ranging from architecture of autonomous
systems to sensor utilization and communication.

I really think this could be relevant for our work in the coming years.

Also very interested to hear in the opening session this morning the focus on agility and agile concepts in wast
research projects such as these. It is good to see that even though they talk about systems engineering, the focus of
analysis and specification has been turned down in favor of capabilities and demonstration.
