I'm really happy that I signed up for this tutorial.

Bob Martin is describing his take on agile development, and in addition to being very inspirational, it really provides
some missing pieces of the puzzle for me.

I will write a thorough summary of this later today, but for now I'll just say that this means a lot of changes to how
we should run our projects. It effectively means the death of the requirements face as we know it. If we don't do this
we will not be able to deliver our projects properly...

I'll leave you with that for now, and hopefully I'll be able to justify this statement in my post this evening.
