Werner Vogels held the opening keynote, talking about the technology platform behind the Amazon.com success.

Amazon.com is really a technical platform, not just a web site. This makes it possible to support other sites, not just
selling products from other vendors, but also running their sites and fully integrating their e-commerce sites. This is
possible due to an architecture with extensive use of webservices to wrap both functionality and data. The services are
split into a set of Foundation services and a set of Aggregator services.  All of which are available to customers of
Amazon.

Very interesting to see how the need for scalability has driven the development of a service oriented architecture using
webservices. The resulting architecture is very close to the SJEF principles that we adhere to.
