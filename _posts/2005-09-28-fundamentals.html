If there is one recurring theme from all the conversations I've had with people at this conference, it is that it is
vital to understand the fundamentals of a problem before we throw ourself into the technology discussions.

How can you choose one technology over another if you don't know the fundamental issues that should guide your decision?

Anyone interessted in the fundamentals of programming languages and language design should check out Abelsons and
Sussman's lecture series
