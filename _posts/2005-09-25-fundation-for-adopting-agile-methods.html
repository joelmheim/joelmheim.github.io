Dave Thomas made this point repeatedly: If you don't have an infrastructure for doing continuous integration and
automated tests then you can forget about transitioning to agile methods.

This is good news for us, since we're there and have been for some time. I personally think it has been the right way
to go, introducing the foundation and gradually maturing towards a better understanding. I think understanding must be
there internally before we can bring in someone from the outside to show us the way. I feel that we are ready now to
move further with agile methods and start to challenge our document driven ways.

So, what am I advocating here? The death of PROMIT, certainly not, but it needs to be reworked seriously. PROMIT is
derived from PROMIS. Why do we have PROMIS? To manage huge, costly oil field development projects with huge amount of
infrastrucure costs. The cost distribution of these projects are low in the specification phase and extremely high once
the infratructure starts to be implemented. On these projects it makes sense to have the decision gates to control the
costs before implementation, but **this doesn't translate into software development**.

Software development cost distribution is no different in the implementation phase than in any other time of the
project. The cost depends on how many people and how long it runs. The best way to control this cost is to set a date
(fix the time), set the teams (fix the people) and let the scope vary within reason.
