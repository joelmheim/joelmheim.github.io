I'll be attending JavaZone this year. I will give a talk about Software Agents and how they can be used to build more
dynamic enterprise applications. If you're going to JavaZone this year and are interested in the subject please check
out the presentation <a href="http://www2.java.no/web/show.do?page=92&amp;articleid=3587">outline</a>.

I hope a lot of you drop in and listen to this talk, as I feel this is an important topic for current and next generation
enterprise applications. Software agents is in itself a very interesting subject, so I don't think you'll be
disappointed.
