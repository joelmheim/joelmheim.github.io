I'm now at the JAOO 2006 conference. This year looks very promising with a lot of great speakers like Eric Evans,
Martin Fowler, Jeff Sutherland, Alistair Cockburn, Jutta Eckstein, Dave Thomas, Gregor Hophe and the list just goes on
and on.

I'll try to attend as many sessions as I can over the next couple of days. My only regret is that I'm alone from
Statoil, as there is just too much for one guy to cover.

I'll keep you posted by things that I pick up during the next days, so be sure to keep your eyes (or RSS readers) fixed
on this blog for the next couple of days.
