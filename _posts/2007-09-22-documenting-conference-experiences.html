There is a pattern emerging in this blog, and that is that all activity is centered around the conferences I attend.

It shouldn't be surprising, as the primary reason for establishing this blog was to document my experiences at
conferences, and a way of conveying some of the experience to my colleagues and friends back home.

The other primary reason is that it's when I'm at a conference that I have the time to reflect on things, get new
inspiration by talking to interesting people and last but not least have the time to write it down in this blog.

Well, it's that time again... Hold on for this years batch of posts...
