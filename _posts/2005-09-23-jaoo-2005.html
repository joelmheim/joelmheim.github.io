It's time for JAOO 2005. There is a lot of interesting talks and sessions, and I want to experience as many of them as
possible.

I will do my best to report on the different sessions that I go to and any interesting events that I vitness.

I will attend a tutorial with Robert Martin (aka. Uncle Bob) on agile methods, and definetly the track on Domain
Specific Languages on Wednesday. I'm also signed up for a tutorial on JDO by the creator Craig Russel, which should be
good. Other than that I'll play it by ear, and pick what catches my attention and time permits.
