I will try to put out the most of the news from JavaOne as the conference proceeds, but this is a very fast paced
conference, and I must say that after the conference started today, it looks like I'm going to be very busy.

There are a lot of sessions, a lot of people, and very little wireless access, so I doubt that I'll be able to post my
blog-entries until after the conference is done on Friday. Please bear with me.
