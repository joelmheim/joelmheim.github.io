I think I start to understand at least part of the Java 5 Generics now. I'm really not convinced that the benefit is worth the syntax and reduced readability. I'll try to explain why...<br /><br />I must confess that I see the point for the simple cases. In Java 1.4 the code for finding payments over a certain limit in a list of Payments would look like this:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: courier new;"><pre>    public List findAllPaymentsOverLimit(List payments,<br />                                         int limit)<br />    {<br />        List overLimitPayments = new ArrayList();<br />        for(Iterator each = payments.iterator(); each.hasNext(); ) {<br />           Payment payment = (Payment) each.next();<br />           if (payment.amount > limit)<br />                overLimitPayments.add(payment);<br />        }<br />        return overLimitPayments;<br />    }<br /></pre></span><br />And the bad thing is that we've all gotten used to that horrible casting syntax. With Java 5 we could change this function to something like this:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: courier new;"><pre>    public List&lt;Payment&gt; findAllPaymentsOverLimit(<br />                            List&lt;Payment&gt; payments,<br />                            int limit)<br />    {<br />        List&lt;Payment&gt; overLimitPayments <br />                = new ArrayList&lt;Payment&gt;();<br />        for (Payment payment : payments) {<br />           if (payment.amount > limit)<br />                overLimitPayments.add(payment);<br />        }<br />        return overLimitPayments;<br />    }<br /></pre></span><br />And that's much better, right?<span style="font-family: courier new;"><span style="font-family: verdana;"></span><br /></span><br />My problem is with the more advanced uses of this new tool. I'll admit that I haven't fully understood this, but if you want to create code that must accept a typed collection or even worse a map, you'll have to learn the more advanced syntax where <span style="font-family: courier new;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: courier new;"><pre>List&lt;? extends Class&gt;</pre></span> or <span style="font-family: courier new;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: courier new;"><pre>List&lt;? super Class&gt;</pre></span><br />This is where it gets hairy, and where I start to think it might just not be worth it. On the other hand, I could leave that problem to the framework makers.
