I've just finished my breakfast, and am waiting for the start of the pre-conference tutorials. Registration should open
any minute, and I've spent the time getting up and running on the conference wireless zone.

Today's session should be good, it's with Robert C. Martin and Dave Thomas (not the pragmatic programmer, the other
one...) on Scaling Agile Methods. Now if you follow this blog you can expect me to rant a lot about agile methods in the
next couple of posts, so if you don't know anything about it please have a look at the
<a href="http://agilemanifesto.org">Agile Manifesto</a>. I really think everybody should know at least what's on
there ;-)

If you look at that site and see the names of the people involved, you'll find Robert C. Martin in addition to other
well known names such as Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, Alistair Cockburn, Ward Cunningham, Dave Thomas (the pragmatic one,
actually) and Andrew Hunt.
