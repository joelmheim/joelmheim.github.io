I'm here in Edinburgh for the SEAS/DTC conference (more on this later), and I must say that this is a very beautiful
city. I'm especially taken by the location of the castle on the hill in the middle of the city.

I went for a walk tonight after settling in at the hotel, and got to see the sun set on the parapets of the castle. Very
beautiful indeed. You should definitely come here if you get the chance.
