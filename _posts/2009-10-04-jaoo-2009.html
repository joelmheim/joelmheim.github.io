Finally, the JAOO conference 2009 has started. Been through a day of tutorials as we are warming up to the conference
proper, that is starting tomorrow.

The program is looking good as usual, and the quality of the tutorials today has been excellent. More on that in a later
post.

The next days promises to be filled with interesting talks and good conversation. Really looking forward to it.
