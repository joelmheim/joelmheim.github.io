This is my first blog entry. I'm a late adopter of this form of communication but I've been following the scene for the
last year or two, and have decided that I want to be a part of it.

My main interests at the moment include Agile methods with special focus on Domain Driven Design, Event Oriented
Architecture, software agents in addition to my love for programming (mainly Java). Recently I've started to learn Ruby,
and I must say that I like what I see. This is cool.

Well, I guess I'll be putting in my two cents from time to time about these subjects, so look out. I also plan to use
this space to report my intake from any conferences I might attend.
